            <p>At WallStreet, our culture comes from how we run the company every day. At the heart of our responsible growth strategy is our commitment to "act responsibly," which includes our commitments to ethical behavior, acting with integrity and complying with laws, rules, regulations and policies that reinforce such behavior.

                We recognize that cultivating a strong culture is an ongoing effort, fostered day after day in both formal and informal ways. Building a unified culture requires thoughtful, purposeful action. This work helped us bring together all of our employees - from different businesses, companies, and countries - to be aligned to our purpose of making financial lives better.</p>
